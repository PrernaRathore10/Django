# Django

## How to start project ?

**Django Overview** :

* Django is a mature and rapid development framework.
* Avoid comparing it to JavaScript frameworks; closer comparisons can be made to Laravel or Ruby on Rails.

**Virtual Environment Setup** :

* Virtual environments isolate dependencies and prevent conflicts.

Commands for creating virtual environments:

* Use `python -m venv <env_name>` or tools like `venv`, `pip`, and `pipx`.
* Activation:
  * On Mac/Linux: `source <env_name>/bin/activate`
  * On Windows: `<env_name>\Scripts\activate`

**Installation Process** :

* Install Django using `pip install django`.
* Use `pip` commands within the virtual environment to ensure proper package management.

**Advantages of Django** :

* Scalable and efficient even on minimal system resources.
* Popular among corporations for reducing infrastructure costs.
* Secure by default, protecting against common vulnerabilities.
